# Demo plan

## Testing

1. Explanation of the code used to create and place TestModels on the sheet. Show how we store them in source code for unit testing.

2. Demo of the unit testing, loading and beautifying.

3. Generation of random circuits and framework for constructing circuits.

4. Constrained random tests, how they are targeted for testing D1. 

## Builders

1. D1 explanation along with demo. Show wires being straightened while ensuring symbols will not intersect.

2. Demo of D2 
    - Show it finds optimal rotation/flip.
    - Show heuristics can be customised for different component types.

3. For D3 we will show conversion of wires to labels. For this all the wires connected to one output port will use the same label. Other output ports will utilise different labels.
