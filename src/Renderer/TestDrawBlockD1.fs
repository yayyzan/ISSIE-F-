(*
My part was to do D1T, the test was make in TestDrawBlockD1.fs

    1) Sheet maker -> makeNearStraightCircuit
    2) Testing Assertion -> makeTest1Circuit

    These are starter Contribution to the team, they will be used to test the code written here.
    Specifically, to test D1B written here. Hence D1B will be called to straighten the circuit created by makeNearStraightCircuit.

    These functions are also present in TestDrawBlock.fs, hence they were tested there. They will also be kept there for the team phase.
    (Where they will be combined with D2T, and D3T).
