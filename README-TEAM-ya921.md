# Summary 

As a key contributor to the development of D1, I will be collaborating closely with a team member who is primarily focused on testing D1. My contributions include the implementation of several helper functions, such as `isParallel` and `getSinglyConnectedSymbols`. These functions are designed to streamline the process.

In addition to these helper functions, I have also initiated the development of a starter beautification algorithm for D1. It is currently designed to straighten parallel constrained wires that are connected to singly connected symbols.

With these implementations, complex cases will be considered and the algorithm will be built upon to handle more in the team-phase.
